# gothx.vim

A go plugin for vim/nvim, which only tries to do things that `gopls` doesn't do. thx.

The idea of this **Experimental** plugin is to provide features not currently supported by `gopls`. As `gopls` grows and matures, relevant features will be aggressively removed from `gothx.vim` (deprecated and replaced with messages 'use your LSC for this').

Note that this plugin doesn't ever hope to cover the same featureset as [vim-go](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go), (nor `govim`). However, vim-go's featureset overlaps with [more recent] LSPs, making it an awkward fit for a polymath like me. I like using the same LSP client across different languages, so I'd sooner only use other plugins which expressly avoid LSP-supplied features.

## Special love for vim-go

I *LOVE* the vim-go project. I fell in love with `vim` through that project, and between 2012-2020, it got me using `vim` or `nvim` as my main editor. Many thanks to that team, especially [fatih](https://github.com/fatih) and [bc](https://github.com/bhcleek). If you ever find an way to adjust vim-go with 'getting out of the way of the Language Server' in mind, then I'm keen to embrace it again. 

## Install in the usual way

For example, using vim-plug:

```
Plug 'laher/gothx.vim'
```

### Installing/updating binaries (once only)

```
:GoThxInstallBinaries
```

NOTE: if you have [async.vim](https://github.com/prabirshrestha/async.vim) installed, `gothx.vim` will install your go things asynchronously â€¦ if not, it'll let you know it's blocking your UI thread.
